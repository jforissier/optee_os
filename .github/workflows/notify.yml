# The purpose of this workflow is to run the scripts/notify_maintainers.py
# for pull requests against the OP-TEE OS main repository in a secure way.
# It runs on the pull_request_target event, which runs the code in the
# target branch, not the code from the PR. This code can therefore be
# trusted.
#
# 1. Job 'check_sensitive_files' determines if the PR modified any critical
#    files (.github/workflows/notify.yml or scripts/notify_maintainers.py).
# 2. Job 'notify_maintainers' runs conditionally:
#    - Automatically runs if no critical files were changed. It checks out
#      the PR branch and executes the notify_maintainers.py script using a
#      PAT (Personal Access Token) which has write access to the optee_os
#      repository's issues. The token is associated with a GitHub user
#      account, it is created on the user's settings page under Developper
#      settings / Personal access tokens. The token is passed as a secret
#      (optee_os repository / Settings / Secrets and variables / Actions /
#      Repository secrets) called GH_NOTIFY_MAINT_TOKEN.
#    - Requires manual approval (via "Re-run jobs") if critical files were
#      changed, enforcing a human security gate. In this case the job status
#      is 'skipped' so the workflow overall status is 'success' and no error
#      is shown. It is up to the project's admins to trigger a re-run or not.
